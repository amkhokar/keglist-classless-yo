# React Hooks Keglist

This is a basic CRUD application that allows you to update quantity of kegs, delete kegs, and see a list of available kegs. The purpose of this project was to show the ease of using react hooks (future standard, but currently in React Alpha) rather than class components.

useState and useEffect are the two hooks used, and in the future I plan to build an application using my own custom hooks.

## Getting Started

To get started you need to clone the repository. Then navigate to the top of the project directory, and use the command "npm install" to install the dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, type "npm start" to open the application in your browser.

## Built With

- React Alpha
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
